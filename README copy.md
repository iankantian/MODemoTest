# Testing of MailOnline's videojs-vast-vpaid plugin
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MailOnline/videojs-vast-vpaid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MailOnline/videojs-vast-vpaid)
#### [DEMO HERE!!!](http://mailonline.github.io/videojs-vast-vpaid)
                       
The demo has a comprehensive environment, with full stack javascript, node modules, and well executed gulp task with a menu generated on the console, bower, linting, kharma, Grunting, etc....

However, I would rather just use the plugin, and not the whole environment.  The development cycle on it is a bit clunky for my taste.  With strict linting, I can't write partial code, only complete and production ready code.  So simple tests aren't an option.  

Solution: step by step bringing over the mvp for the plugin to see how it works and actually be able to follow what on Earth it's doing!
